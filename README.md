# Truffle
**Compile-time memory management without caveats**

Truffle is a statically-typed compiled language built on LLVM that aims to offer compile-time memory management without caveats. It combines the performance benefits of languages like C/C++ with the ease of memory safety, eliminating the manual memory management pitfalls associated with low-level languages and the complexity of ownership models found in modern languages like Rust.
