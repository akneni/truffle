**Compile-time memory management without caveats**

Truffle is a statically-typed compiled language built on LLVM that aims to offer compile-time memory management without caveats. It combines the performance benefits of languages like C/C++ with the ease of memory safety, eliminating the manual memory management pitfalls associated with low-level languages and the complexity of ownership models found in modern languages like Rust.
Truffle is compiler engine that provides an easy way to manage memory at compile time without burdening the user with the unsaftey manual memory management or the complexity of an ownership model. Truffle is also a programming language; this language acts as a front end to the truffle compiler engine meant to showcase it's abilities.

## üöß Work In Progress

**Truffle is currently under active development.** While many core concepts are already in place, the language is continuously evolving as we build out features, refine its design, and improve performance. Please note that certain areas of the language and its toolchain are still being worked on, and we welcome feedback from early adopters and contributors.
Key areas we are working on:
- Enhanced error handling and diagnostics
- Expanded standard library
- Optimized LLVM integration
- More comprehensive benchmarking and performance testing
- Extensive documentation
Expect frequent updates as we iterate and bring Truffle closer to production readiness.

## üöÄ Features
- **Compile-Time Memory Management**: Memory management is resolved at compile time, avoiding runtime overhead.
- **LLVM Backend**: Truffle leverages the LLVM backend for efficient, optimized code generation.
- **Type Safety**: Strong static typing with type inference and immutability by default.
- **Simplicity & Performance**: Designed for low-level systems programming without the pitfalls of manual memory handling.
- **Developer Velocity**: Unlike C/C++ and Rust, Truffle aims to be easy to quickly iterate with.
- **Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**: The main purpose of this project is to create a compiler engine that manages memory at compile time without caveats. The truffle language itself merely acts as a front end to this compiler engine to show case it's abilities. 
**Note:** Truffle is in a very early state and nearly everything is currently under active development.
Key areas currently being worked on:
- **LLVM Integration**: Leveraging LLVM's backend for highly efficient code generation.
- **AutoFree Functionality**: Implementing an automatic memory cleanup feature where the compiler determines when objects are no longer in use and frees memory without developer intervention. This feature aims to eliminate the need for manual deallocation while ensuring efficient memory use, offering the best of both worlds‚Äîhigh performance without the risk of memory leaks.
- **LLM Enabled Optimization**: This is a highly experimental feature. While LLVM optimizes LLVM IR, it does not focus extensively on optimizing the final machine code for specific target architectures. We are experimenting with using a Large Language Model (LLM) to optimize sections of the final machine code. This feature is inspired by a [research paper published by Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/meta-large-language-model-compiler-foundation-models-of-compiler-optimization/).
